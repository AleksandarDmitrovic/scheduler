# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single-page interview booking application.

Using the latest tools and techniques, I built and tested this as a React application that allows users to book, edit and cancel interviews. Using a combination of concise APIs with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience.

I deployed the server to Heroku, and the client side to Netlify. Click the link below to see the deployed application.
